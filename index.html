            <p> 
                DK!SONICTALE is an UNDERTALE AU that places Sonic the Hedgehog characters into UNDERTALE's setting, 
                keeping their personalities, histories, and beliefs intact while exploring them in a new context. 
                Inspiration has been taken from UNDERTOAD, an AU created by LucasPucas and co-created by Starfury and Patwhit01 
                that blends Super Mario characters with UNDERTALE in a very unique way.
                <br><br>
                Due to the many different portrayals of Sonic the Hedgehog over the years, this AU is a composite of each of them, 
                blending every single interpretation of the franchise that I could find into one unique package. 
                The planet is called Earth, the characters are called Mobians, and various obscure Sonic characters have the 
                potential to show up in this story.
                <br><br>
                The story tackles the uprooting of one's history, and the many coping mechanisms that we use to distract ourselves 
                from the pain of loss. If you've ever moved frequently as a child or had your childhood uprooted, 
                you know all too well the themes this story will be tackling...
