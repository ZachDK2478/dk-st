        <p> DK!SONICTALE is an UNDERTALE AU that places Sonic the Hedgehog characters into UNDERTALE's setting 
            without drastically altering their personalities and history. Inspiration has been taken from UNDERTOAD, 
            an AU created by LucasPucas and co-created by Starfury and Patwhit01. 
            <br><br>
            Due to the many different portrayals of Sonic the Hedgehog over the years, this AU is a composite of each of them. 
            The planet is called Earth, the characters are called Mobians (instead of Monsters!) and various obscure characters 
            have the potential to show up in this story.
            <br><br>
            The story tackles the uprooting of one's history, and the many coping mechanisms that we use to distract ourselves 
            from the pain of loss. If you've ever moved frequently as a child or had your childhood uprooted, you know all too 
            well the themes this story will be tackling.
