        <p>
            Class "E" (also known as "Classie") is an artificial lifeform created by <a id="eggman-link" href="../characters/eggman.html">Dr. Ivo 
            "Eggman" Robotnik</a> for the purpose of finding a way out of the UNDERGROUND. Unfortunately for Eggman, using samples 
            of Sonic's DETERMINATION to create an unfeeling artificial hedgehog didn't exactly work out, and now we have a 
            genocidal Classic Sonic walking around, toying with lives and playing god until the day Cream returns.
            <br><br>
            Unfinished.

        <h1 class="header-glow-CLE"> SHORTER INFO </h1>
        <p>
            * The nickname "Classie" was given to him by <a id="sonic-link" href="../characters/sonic.html">Sonic</a>, and Classie actually 
            preferred it. He thought it made him sound "classy."
            <br>
            * Classie is not mute. He can speak, but only does so when he feels like he has something to say.
            <br>
            * Upon meeting Cream, Classie pretended to be mute to toy with her and see what she would do. After all, he knows 
            she has more DETERMINATION than him.
