        <p>
            Sonic the Hedgehog is DK!SONICTALE's closest parallel to Sans the Skeleton. Once a carefree hero battling the 
            maniacal <a href="../characters/eggman.html">Dr. Eggman,</a> Sonic has begun to slow down as a result of being trapped 
            in this world. The discoveries made, alongside the bleak situation they're in, it was all just too much for him. 
            As a result, he grew discouraged. Giving up on escape, Sonic began to patrol the icy forest he called home, hoping 
            that one day, they'll all find a savior.
            <br><br>
            Unfortunately for him, that savior ended up being a child.
            <br>
            Great.
            <br>
            He's praying now that Cream knows what she's doing.
            <br><br>
