        <h1 class="header-glow-HNY"> HONEY THE CAT </h1>
        <p>
            Honey is one of the more surprising additions to the DK!SONICTALE cast, as she is a character from Sonic the Fighters 
            and the Archie Sonic the Hedgehog comics. Within this AU, she fulfills a dual role, being the closest parallel 
            to both Grillby and Muffet at the same time. She owns an all-in-one parlor within the Ice Cap Forest. Despite 
            her appearing like a side character, her connection to multiple main cast members puts her into a psuedo main 
            character role.
            <br><br>
            Mischevious, a little bit self-serving, but a pillar of the community, Honey is the type of person who you 
            NEED in a situation like this. She embodies community and the reconstruction of society in the face of great loss 
            and trauma.
