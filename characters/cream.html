        <h1 class="header-glow-CRM"> CREAM THE RABBIT </h1>
        <p>
            The protagonist of DK!SONICTALE. Cream is this AU's closest parallel to Frisk, however she has some differences. 
            First of all, Cream talks very often, voicing her opinions on her surroundings. Second of all, there is no narrator. 
            Cream is both Frisk and Chara in this AU.
            <br><br>
            Unfinished.
            <br><br>

        <h1 class="header-glow-CRM"> SHORTER INFO </h1>
        <p>
            * Cream is the protagonist of DK!SONICTALE.
            <br>
            * Cream is six years old during the events of this story.. She has not experienced the six year time skip that the 
            rest of the world has.
            <br>
            * Due to the nature of DETERMINATION, Cream will have different routes she can take. Pacifist, Neutral, and Genocide 
            (No Mercy).
            <br>
            * In DK!SONICTALE, Cream represents escapism and how it can be okay in moderation (Pacifist), but can be harmful to yourself 
            and others if taken too far (Genocide/No Mercy).
            <br>
            * The Genocide/No Mercy runs in this AU will take the "all just a game" perspective and turn it into the central idea 
            of Cream's point of view.
            <br>
            * One of Cream's themes will likely use the freedom leitmotif from DELTARUNE. In fact, it'll probably be used a bit in 
            this AU's soundtrack to symbolize how much every Mobian longs for freedom from the UNDERGROUND.
